### Fixed
- Fixed an incorrect cast from `u8` to `i16` in `LoRaPacketStatus::snr_pkt`
- Renamed function `TcxoMode::set_txco_trim` to `TcxoMode::set_tcxo_trim` to fix spelling.
- Renamed enum `CmdStatus::Avaliable` to `CmdStatus::Available` to fix spelling.

## [0.6.1] - 2022-08-01
### Fixed
- Fixed undefined behavior in SPI full duplex RX DMA transfers.

## [0.6.0] - 2022-07-04
### Added
- Added `rcc::Lsco` to use the low-speed oscillator output.

- Added `Rtc::recalibration_pending`.
- Added `Rtc::is_alarm_{a,b}_en`.
- Added methods to utilize ADC oversampling.

### Changed
- `Rtc.alarm_{a,b}` returns `Alarm` instead of `Option<Alarm>`.
- Updated `stm32-rs` from `0.14.0` to `0.15.1`.

### Fixed

### Added
- Added `set_sleep_clock` to GPIO ports to enable and disable clocks during sleep.
- Added `subghz::Timeout::saturating_add`.
- Added `SubGhz.set_rtc_period` and `SubGhz.restart_rtc` methods required to workaround an erratum with `SubGhz.set_rx_duty_cycle`.
- Added `SubGhz.new_no_reset` and `SubGhz.new_with_dma_no_reset` to create a `SubGhz` without resetting the radio.

### Changed
- Changed minimum supported rust version from 1.57 to 1.60.

### Fixed
- Fixed a typo in the `Exti::set_falling_trigger` function name.
- Fixed endianness in `SubGhz.op_error`.

## [0.4.0] - 2022-01-08
### Added
- Added a `is_pending` method to the `gpio::Exti` trait.
- Added alarm functionality to the RTC.
- Added `Rtc.is_wakeup_timer_en`.
- Added `flash::flash_range`.

### Changed
- Replaced `Debug` implementation with `Display` implementation for:
  - `subghz::FskPacketStatus`
  - `subghz::LoRaPacketStatus`
  - `subghz::Stats`
  - `subghz::Status`
- `Flash::standard_program_generic` now checks for overflow.

### Fixed
- Fixed an off-by-one error in `flash::Page::addr_range`.

### Removed

## [0.3.0] - 2021-12-20
### Added
- Added `info::Core::CT` to get the CPU core at compile time.
- Added `info::Core::from_cpuid()` to get the CPU core at runtime.

- Added `info::uid::PTR`.

### Changed
- Changed minimum rust version from 1.56 to 1.57 for `const_panic`.
- `info::UID64`
  - Moved to `info::Uid64::PTR`.
  - Changed the type from `*const u8` to `*const u32`.
- Moved functions in `info` into the associated structs/enums.
  - Moved `info::uid64` to `info::Uid64::from_device`.
  - Moved `info::uid64_devnum` to `info::Uid64::read_devnum`.
  - Moved `info::package` to `info::Package::from_device`.
  - Moved `info::uid` to `info::Uid::from_device`.
- Added `#[inline]` to `util::new_delay` and `util::reset_cycle_count`.
- Large dependencies are now optional.
  - `embedded-time` is now an optional feature.
    - Changed `I2C::new` to use `u32` instead of `embedded_time::Hertz`.
